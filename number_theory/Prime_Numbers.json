  "<p><b>Prime numbers</b> are positive integers greater than 1 with exactly two factors, 1 and the number itself. Examples include 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. A non-prime integer is called <b>composite</b>.</p><p>1 is neither prime nor composite.</p><p><b>Twin Prime Conjecture:</b> There are infinitely many prime numbers \\(p\\) for which is \\(p+2\\) also a prime number. Examples include 3 (as 5 is prime), 17 (as 19 is prime) and 41 (as 43 is prime).</p><p><b>Goldbach's conjecture:</b> Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.</p><p>A <b>Mersenne prime</b> is a prime number in the form \\(2^p - 1\\) for some prime \\(p\\).</p><p><b><u>Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic:</u></b> Every positive integer can be written as a product of primes (possibly with repetition).</p>",
